Sample Phalcon Project
----------------------
This is a sample project for our Heroku buildpack https://github.com/droc-ventures/heroku-nginx-php-phalcon.

Configurations
--------------
There are sample configurations for Nginx and PHP within this project. The Nginx configuration has some tweaks and includes the necessary rewrites to properly redirect to the controllers.

Note
----
This project was hastily put together to test our buildpack. It's based on the Phalcon tutorial and has only two controllers /Index and /Test.
